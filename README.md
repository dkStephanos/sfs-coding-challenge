# sfs-coding-challenge - React, Part 1

For this excercise, you will find a fully built blog app in modern React, under the directory: `my-app`. 

Begin by following readme instructions inside that directory to install dependencies and start the react server. You will need node and either npm/yarn.

Once the application has started, it will open a browser, and you will see the first in a series of errors. 

Next, from a seperate terminal, run this command to host the sample data: `json-server -p 8000 data/db.json`.

The application itself is a basic blog site. The home page is a list of all blog entries, and there are seperate views to create a post as well as view the details and delete a post. The blog posts themselves are interacted with through the json-server api.

The app itslef has numerous issues preventing it from functioning properly. All of the files containing errors can be found in the `src` directory. To complete this assignment, identify and resolve all of the bugs present until the blog app is functional. Commit your work along the way, and when you are finished, switch to the `django` branch for part 2.
